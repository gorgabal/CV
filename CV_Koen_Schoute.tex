%I am exited to be able to do my graduation internship at Synetic. Having worked at previous jobs that developed application and web-development, I think I might be a good candidate for this internship. I think my previous experiences will help to make this a successful internship. 
%
%As a side point: the atmosphere just seems to be quite good, judging from the website. So I hope I can continue working for you after my graduation is over. 
%
%I am eagerly awaiting your response.
